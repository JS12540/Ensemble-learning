# Ensemble Learning

## Introduction

Ensemble learning is a powerful technique in machine learning where multiple models are combined to improve predictive performance. Each individual model might have its strengths and weaknesses, but by combining them, the ensemble can achieve better results than any individual model alone. In this README, we will delve into various ensemble methods and their implementations.

## 1. Bagging Ensembles (Lesson 02)

Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, is a technique where multiple models are trained on different subsets of the training data, which are randomly sampled with replacement. This technique helps in reducing variance and overfitting. Some popular bagging algorithms include Random Forest and Bagged Decision Trees.

## 2. Random Forest Ensemble (Lesson 03)

Random Forest is an extension of bagging that further decorrelates the base models by selecting a random subset of features at each split of the decision tree. This randomness helps in creating a diverse set of trees, which collectively provide more robust predictions.

## 3. AdaBoost Ensemble (Lesson 04)

AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is an ensemble method that focuses on improving the performance of weak learners iteratively. It assigns higher weights to the misclassified instances in each iteration, forcing subsequent weak learners to focus more on those instances. The final prediction is a weighted sum of the individual weak learners.

## 4. Gradient Boosting Ensemble (Lesson 05)

Gradient Boosting is another boosting technique that builds an ensemble of weak learners sequentially, with each new learner correcting the errors made by the previous ones. Unlike AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting optimizes a loss function in the space of the model parameters.

## 5. Voting Ensemble (Lesson 06)

Voting ensembles combine predictions from multiple models by either taking a simple majority (hard voting) or averaging the predicted probabilities (soft voting). This technique works well when the individual models have diverse behaviors and make uncorrelated errors.

## 6. Stacking Ensemble (Lesson 07)

Stacking, also known as Stacked Generalization, involves training a meta-model that learns how to combine the predictions of several base models. Instead of simple averaging or voting, stacking learns the optimal way to blend the predictions, which often leads to improved performance.

## Conclusion

Ensemble methods offer a powerful approach to machine learning by leveraging the strengths of multiple models. By combining diverse models, ensembles can often achieve better generalization and robustness compared to individual models. Understanding and implementing these ensemble techniques can significantly enhance predictive performance in various machine learning tasks.
